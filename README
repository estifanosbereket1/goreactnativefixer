# React Native Fixer CLI

`goreactnative` is a fast, simple, and portable CLI tool written in Go to automate common setup and fixes for React Native projects. It prebuilds Android native folders and replaces the `gradle.properties` file with a predefined template to ensure consistent project configuration.  

---

## Features

- Automatically detects React Native projects (`app.json` present).  
- Runs `npx expo prebuild --platform android` to generate native Android files.  
- Automatically overwrites the `android/gradle.properties` file with a standard template.  
- Optionally updates Java and Javac alternatives using `sudo` if needed.  
- Portable: template files are embedded into the binary using Go `embed`, so no external dependencies.  

---

## Requirements

- [Go 1.20+](https://go.dev/dl/) (for building from source).  
- Node.js & npm/yarn/pnpm (for running Expo commands).  
- Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`).  
- React Native project with `app.json`.  
- `sudo` privileges (only if updating Java alternatives).
